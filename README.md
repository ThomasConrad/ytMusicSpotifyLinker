# YouTube Music Spotify Linker

A full-stack application that synchronizes playlists between YouTube Music and Spotify using the Songlink API for cross-platform song matching.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Rust with Axum web framework, SQLite database, session-based authentication
- **Frontend**: SolidJS with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and dark mode support
- **Song Matching**: Songlink/Odesli API integration for cross-platform song discovery

## Development Status

### Current State
The application has a solid foundation with:
- Complete authentication system
- Comprehensive database schema
- Working Songlink integration
- Basic API structure
- Modern frontend framework setup

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **OAuth Integration** - Connect to YouTube Music and Spotify APIs
2. **Playlist Fetching** - Implement API calls to retrieve playlists
3. **Frontend-Backend Auth Fix** - Standardize authentication method
4. **Core Sync Logic** - Implement playlist comparison and synchronization
5. **Background Processing** - Add automatic sync monitoring
6. **UI Enhancement** - Build dashboard for playlist management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable)
- Node.js 18+
- SQLite

### Backend Development
```bash
cd backend
cargo run  # Starts server on port 3000
cargo test # Run tests
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # Starts dev server on port 5173
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Database
- Database file: `backend/db.sqlite`
- Migrations applied automatically on startup
- Default test user: `ferris` / `hunter42`

## API Documentation

### Authentication
- Session-based authentication
- `/login` - User login (form-based)
- `/logout` - User logout
- `/register` - User registration (JSON)

### Protected Endpoints
All watcher endpoints require authentication:
- `GET /watchers` - List watchers
- `POST /watchers` - Create watcher
- `GET /watchers/{name}/start` - Start sync
- `GET /watchers/{name}/stop` - Stop sync
- `GET /watchers/{name}/preview` - Preview changes

## Contributing
