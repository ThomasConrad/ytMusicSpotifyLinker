# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete end-to-end user authentication system and homepage dashboard for the YouTube Music/Spotify playlist linking application. The implementation will be structured as a series of small, focused commits with backend implementation preceding frontend integration at each stage.

The system will provide secure user login, session management, and a comprehensive dashboard where users can view and manage their playlist synchronization watchers, connected services, and sync history. Currently, there is a mismatch between the backend (session-based auth with HTML forms) and frontend (expecting JWT-based JSON APIs). This feature will unify the authentication approach through incremental, isolated changes.

## Implementation Philosophy

**Backend-First Approach**: All backend functionality will be implemented and tested before corresponding frontend changes, ensuring each commit has a clear, focused responsibility:

- Login backend API → Login frontend integration
- User profile backend API → User profile frontend integration  
- Watcher management backend API → Watcher management frontend UI
- Dashboard backend API → Dashboard frontend implementation

Each commit will address the smallest logical scope that provides value while maintaining system integrity.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product steering goals by:
- **Eliminating friction**: Providing seamless authentication without technical barriers
- **Trust through transparency**: Clear user interface showing sync status and playlist information
- **User-centric design**: Dashboard prioritizes user needs and playlist management workflows
- **Progressive disclosure**: Simple login flow with advanced features accessible through the dashboard

### Requirement 4: Service Connection Status API (Backend First)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement API endpoints that provide service connection status for YouTube Music and Spotify integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting connection status THEN the backend SHALL return current OAuth token validity for each service
2. WHEN connection tokens are expired THEN the backend SHALL indicate re-authentication requirements
3. WHEN disconnecting services THEN the backend SHALL remove stored credentials and confirm removal
4. WHEN OAuth callbacks are received THEN the backend SHALL store tokens securely and return connection status
5. WHEN service API calls fail THEN the backend SHALL log errors and update connection status appropriately

### Requirement 5: Unified Frontend Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in using a modern, responsive interface that integrates seamlessly with the backend session system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting login credentials THEN the frontend SHALL use JSON API and handle responses appropriately
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the frontend SHALL store session state and redirect to dashboard
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the frontend SHALL display specific error messages without page refresh
4. WHEN session expires THEN the frontend SHALL detect expiration and redirect to login with clear messaging
5. WHEN logging out THEN the frontend SHALL clear local state and redirect appropriately

### Requirement 6: Dashboard Data Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a comprehensive dashboard that displays all my playlist synchronization information in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing dashboard THEN the frontend SHALL load user profile, watchers, and recent activity via API calls
2. WHEN displaying watcher information THEN the frontend SHALL show complete status including last sync time and success rate
3. WHEN service connections are incomplete THEN the frontend SHALL guide users through connection process
4. WHEN creating new watchers THEN the frontend SHALL use API to validate and create configurations
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the frontend SHALL display contextual error information and suggest resolution steps

### Requirement 7: Real-time Sync Operation Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates when sync operations are running, so I can monitor progress and identify issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync operations start THEN the dashboard SHALL display progress indicators and status updates
2. WHEN sync operations complete THEN the dashboard SHALL show results summary with success/failure counts
3. WHEN sync operations fail THEN the dashboard SHALL display error details and suggested remediation
4. WHEN previewing sync changes THEN the dashboard SHALL show detailed before/after comparison
5. WHEN multiple watchers are active THEN the dashboard SHALL display status for each watcher independently

### Requirement 8: Progressive Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear, actionable feedback when problems occur, with guidance on how to resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
