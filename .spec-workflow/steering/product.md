# Product Steering

## Vision & Mission

### Vision
Create a seamless, reliable, and user-friendly platform that automatically synchronizes music playlists between YouTube Music and Spotify, eliminating the need for users to manually recreate playlists across platforms.

### Mission
Solve the common problem of music platform fragmentation by providing intelligent playlist synchronization that:
- Preserves user music discovery and curation across platforms
- Reduces friction when switching between or using multiple streaming services
- Maintains playlist integrity through smart song matching and conflict resolution

### Target Users
- **Multi-platform music listeners** who use both YouTube Music and Spotify
- **Platform switchers** migrating their music library between services
- **Music curators** managing playlists across multiple platforms for broader reach
- **Casual users** who want their music accessible regardless of which app they open

### Problem Statement
Music streaming platform lock-in forces users to choose between platforms or manually maintain duplicate playlists. This creates:
- Wasted time recreating playlists on different platforms
- Loss of music discovery when switching services
- Fragmented listening experience across different devices/contexts
- Platform dependency that limits user flexibility

## User Experience Principles

### Core UX Guidelines
- **Simplicity First**: Complex synchronization should be invisible to users
- **Trust Through Transparency**: Show users exactly what will be synced before it happens
- **Non-Destructive Operations**: Never delete or modify playlists without explicit user consent
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple use cases, expose advanced features as needed
- **Error Recovery**: Provide clear paths forward when syncs fail or songs can't be matched

### Design System Principles
- **Clean, Modern Interface**: Minimalist design focused on playlist management
- **Dark Mode Support**: Essential for music applications used in various lighting conditions
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: Many users manage music on mobile devices
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Show sync progress and status updates immediately
- **Contextual Help**: Provide assistance exactly when and where users need it

### Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Ensure application is usable by everyone
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse/touch input
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic markup and ARIA labels
- **Color Accessibility**: Sufficient contrast ratios, no color-only information
- **Responsive Text**: Support browser zoom up to 200%

### Performance Standards
- **Fast Initial Load**: <3 seconds for dashboard on standard broadband
- **Responsive Interactions**: <200ms for UI feedback
- **Efficient Syncing**: Background processing doesn't block user interface
- **Offline Resilience**: Core functionality works during network interruptions
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal battery/CPU impact during background syncing

## Product Development Philosophy

### User-Centric Design
All features must solve real user problems and undergo user testing before implementation. Feature complexity should be hidden behind intuitive interfaces.

### Platform Agnostic
While initially supporting YouTube Music and Spotify, the architecture should support adding new platforms without major refactoring.

### Data Privacy & Security
User data, especially authentication tokens and playlist information, must be handled with enterprise-level security. Users should maintain full control over their data.

### Sustainable Growth
Features should be built for long-term maintenance and scalability. Technical debt should be addressed proactively to ensure sustainable development velocity.
